We always aim to maximize the space and make it functional, according to your needs, with everything considered-from custom cabinets down to the countertops. Upon the design approval, we do procurement down to the last minute details, careful sourcing and thorough inspection of materials that would match your style-from flooring to backplash tiles down to fixtures-just to assure it passes the mark. At this point in time, we would then schedule a start date. The actual renovation starts with removal of old fixtures, area prep, followed by plumbing and electrical inspection. We make sure everything is up to code and all required permits are pulled.  Cabinets, countertops, and tiles are installed with precision as this space is transformed into the heart of your home. After the last details, like painting and hardware installation, we do a deep clean and walkthrough with you to make sure your satisfaction is met!",

    "sectionP1": "Your bathroom is a place to relax and enjoy the quietness of it all. The last thing you want is to fumble through the clutter and hit your elbows on bathroom fixtures. Renova Contractors LLC gives you the option to use all of the space in your bathroom or expand the room itself. Expansion can be costly because extensive architectural and structural changes, along with electrical and plumbing work, are required. Depending on your budget, we can discuss the different options you have.",
    "sectionP2": "If your budget does not allow for wall relocation, we propose a solution that optimizes the available space in the room. This involves removing your tub and shower combination to create a single walk-in shower, which you can customize to your preferred dimensions. Built-in wall shelves and niches can make the bathroom feel much more open, and if you install a pedestal sink, you're giving it a less cluttered feel. Our interior designer will make sure that the new bathroom layout is functional and optimal. When you want to extend your bathroom beyond its current footprint, we will have our structural engineer consult you on how to best proceed and the project's feasibility. When doing a bathroom remodel, we often change the electrical wiring and the layout of the plumbing pipes, so when doing such an extensive remodel, there will be no problem with the additional wiring and plumbing. Keep in mind that the installation of bathroom tiles heavily depends not only on the square footage, but also on the overall complexity of the tile and its pattern. For example, a small walk-in shower with a complex tile design may cost more than a larger walk-in shower with a simple, pattern-free design. When doing a bathroom remodel, we provide you with a cost sheet that is transparent and very accurate. We pride ourselves on our accuracy with the price, so we can explore different options for the bathroom renovation project.",

Before the project starts, we provide you with a detailed project schedule that we adhere to vigorously while remaining flexible. Renova Contractors LLC believes in our management style and adherence to deadlines, so we also provide you with a $50 discount for every day that we are behind. We provide you with a variety of discounts and complimentary services, including free consultations with our interior designer and free 3D renderings. Our architect also offers complimentary consultations. Imagine having three professionals working on your bathroom renovation project at all times: an interior designer, an architect, and a project manager. However, we offer even more. At home or on vacation, you can check our video monitoring system we installed with your permission to track the project's progress. You can relax and not worry. Once the designer finalizes the 3D rendering based on your notes and vision, we begin procuring bathroom fixtures such as tubs, faucets, and showerheads. We offer free delivery and always pass on our contractor discount to you.",
    "section2P2": "Each bathroom renovation project entails electrical and plumbing installation; for all this, our licensed electricians and licensed plumbers pull permits and pass all necessary inspections. Our tile installation team is perfect at making sure that your shower is waterproof and sealed correctly. Before we tile a custom shower, the project manager thoroughly inspects it for water leaks and drainage. You must approve each stage of the bathroom renovation project before we proceed to the next. We keep you updated daily and make sure you are up to date with all the things going on. With an extensive remodel, we also offer our clients a complimentary house cleaning. After you do a final walkthrough of the project with us, we will then provide you with a free house cleaning service as a token of appreciation.",
