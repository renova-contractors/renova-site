Services\n\n### 3.1 Scope of Services\n\nRenova Contractors LLC provides home renovation and contracting services, including but not limited to kitchen remodeling, bathroom remodeling, attic finishing, and general home improvement. All services are provided 'as is' and 'as available' and are subject to these Terms and any specific agreements between Renova Contractors LLC and the client. Renova Contractors LLC makes no warranties regarding the results, accuracy, or reliability of any services performed.\n\n### 3.2 Estimates and Contracts\n\nAll estimates provided by Renova Contractors LLC are non-binding and are subject to change based on variables such as material costs, labor fluctuations, and scope adjustments. A formal contract will be executed prior to the commencement of any work, detailing the specific terms, scope, and costs. The contract must be signed by both parties before any work begins. Any modifications to the scope of work must be documented in a written change order and may result in additional costs and extended timelines.\n\n## 4. Payment Terms\n\n### 4.1 Payment Schedule\n\nPayments are due according to the payment schedule outlined in the contract. Renova Contractors LLC requires an initial deposit of at least 50% of the total contract amount before work commences. Subsequent payments are due upon reaching agreed-upon project milestones, with the final payment due immediately upon project completion. Non-payment or late payment will result in immediate suspension of work and may incur additional charges, including but not limited to interest, legal fees, and collection costs.\n\n### 4.2 Late Payments\n\nLate payments will incur a late fee of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance or the maximum allowed by law, whichever is greater. If payment is not received within 10 days of the due date, Renova Contractors LLC reserves the right to halt all work until payment is made in full. If the client fails to make payment within 30 days, Renova Contractors LLC may terminate the contract and seek full payment for all completed work, materials, and any additional costs incurred.\n\n### 4.3 Refunds\n\nAll payments made to Renova Contractors LLC are non-refundable. In the event of a dispute, Renova Contractors LLC will make reasonable efforts to resolve the issue, but reserves the right to retain any payments made for work already completed, materials purchased, and any costs incurred. Clients waive any right to chargebacks or other forms of payment reversals.\n\n## 5. Client Responsibilities\n\n### 5.1 Access to Property\n\nThe client is responsible for providing Renova Contractors LLC with unobstructed access to the property during agreed-upon working hours. The client must ensure that all necessary permits, approvals, and legal authorizations are secured before work commences, unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract. Delays caused by the client's failure to secure necessary permits or provide access may result in additional charges and extended project timelines.\n\n### 5.2 Preparation of Work Area\n\nThe client is responsible for preparing the work area, which includes removing personal belongings, furniture, and any other obstructions. Renova Contractors LLC is not liable for damage to items that are not removed from the work area.

Warranties and Disclaimers\n\n### 6.1 Limited Warranty\n\nRenova Contractors LLC offers a limited warranty on workmanship for a period of 1 year from the date of project completion. This warranty is strictly limited to defects in workmanship and does not cover materials, normal wear and tear, or damage caused by misuse, neglect, or external factors. Any warranty claims must be submitted in writing within the warranty period. Renova Contractors LLC reserves the right to inspect and remedy any valid claims at its sole discretion.\n\n### 6.2 Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nExcept as expressly provided in these Terms, all services are provided 'as is' and 'as available', without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The client assumes all risks associated with the use of the services.\n\n## 7.

Indemnification\n\nThe client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Renova Contractors LLC, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to the client's use of our website or services, the client's breach of these Terms, or the client's violation of any rights of a third party. This indemnification obligation survives the termination of these Terms and the completion of services.\n\n## 9. Termination\n\nRenova Contractors LLC reserves the right to terminate or suspend the client's access to our website and services at any time, without notice, for conduct that it believes violates these Terms, is harmful to its interests, or for any other reason at its sole discretion.
