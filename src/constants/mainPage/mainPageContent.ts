### Product Selection Process – Built Around Your Remodel

When you work with **Renova Contractors LLC** — a licensed **general contractor in Seattle** — we don’t just help you build. We help you make smart product choices that actually fit your remodel. Most homeowners don’t have time to compare 20 brands of tile or sift through flooring specs. That’s what we’re here for.

We’ve worked on enough remodels to know what holds up — and what doesn’t. From structural materials to visible finishes, we guide you through it all based on function, appearance, and cost.

---

### What We Help You Choose 🛠️

- 🪵 **Cabinets and storage systems** – We’ll compare quality between plywood-core, MDF, and frameless options.
- 🧱 **Tile and flooring** – We know which materials perform well in high-use areas (and which chip or stain fast).
- 🚿 **Plumbing fixtures** – Brand vs. build quality. We’ve installed everything from builder-grade to custom imports.
- 🔌 **Lighting** – We’ll help you pick fixtures that meet code, light the space well, and don’t blow your budget.

---

### What You Get When We Handle It 🔍

- 📦 **Direct supplier access** – We buy at contractor pricing, and you get the savings.
- 🧾 **One plan, no markups** – No mystery materials, no upsells halfway through.
- 🗂️ **Pre-scheduled deliveries** – We make sure product timing lines up with the construction schedule.
- 📁 **Real recommendations** – Not sponsored lists. We recommend what we’ve used on real jobs and trust to perform.

---

### Why It Matters 🧠

A lot of products look great in showrooms but don’t hold up under daily use. Some warp. Some chip. Others are just overpriced. As a trusted **Seattle home remodeling contractor**, we’ve already seen what works in Seattle homes — and what causes callbacks two years later.

We make sure your selections fit the job, pass code, and last. You won’t waste time guessing — and won’t overspend where it’s not needed. That’s how you keep a remodel on track, both now and long-term.

At times, our architect works closely with the city and can get permits approved faster than usual. Because Renova Contractors LLC has you covered, our clients won't have to run around and look for a company that can do their architectural plans.\n\nWith our interior design services 🖼️, we also make sure that our clients receive the best products that will fit their space. Our interior designer is a complimentary service that we offer to clients who choose to work with Renova Contractors LLC. In addition to these two services, we offer a variety of other services that you may find useful for your home and yard.\n\nWe offer landscaping and hardscaping services 🌳. Since we don’t think construction and landscaping nowadays are two separate things, landscaping has a lot of plumbing and electrical components to it, whereas hardscaping has a lot to do with masonry and cement work. We provide plumbing 🚰 and electrical services 💡, which are essential components for any remodeling project. No bathroom renovation or kitchen remodel can avoid dealing with plumbing and electrical wiring. By providing these services, we ensure the project stays on schedule and promptly resolves any unexpected issues.\n\nWe offer roof and deck installation 🏡 as part of our exterior services, understanding that these areas of the house often face the most issues that require prompt resolution for our clients' comfort. Offering such a wide range of services does not mean losing quality. Renova Contractors LLC employs highly skilled professionals who will always ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nAll of our services enable us to grow as a company and develop better relationships with our clients.

/* ### Unique Approach to Every Project\n\nWith each project being unique, we have no clear-cut formula for all of our projects. Every bathroom remodel, kitchen remodel, or landscaping project requires its method and approach. **All projects have an unexpected issue** that you can run into at any time, so you must be prepared for those moments and that is done by carefully planning and relying on your previous experience with similar projects.\n\n### Initial Consultation and Estimate\n\nWe start by **consultation and an estimate** for your project, the consultation is initial but we try to dig deep just to make sure that our estimate that you will get the next day is as detailed as possible. During the first meeting, we explain in detail what needs to be done in preparation for the project.\n\n### Detailed Planning and Design\n\nWhile sending out an estimate does give you a clear picture, we also want you to have a **free consultation with our designers**, they will be able to point you in the right direction and help you visualize your project by rendering you a 3D model. After this, we would narrow down the project and make sure you are happy with the design and selected materials. If not, we make adjustments, then we start **ordering everything ahead of time** that can be stored at our warehouses.\n\n### Ordering and Storing Materials\n\nYou can use our online store which has **wholesale prices and contractor discounts** to order your finishes.\n\n- **Contractor discounts and wholesale prices** are the prices that contractors pay when they purchase materials from a licensed contractor store.\n- We don’t add any fees and just pass the discount to you, pretty much purchasing the materials on your behalf and passing on to you the low cost.\n- The ordered materials we will deliver to you or our warehouse for storage and then install them when the time comes.\n\n### Permits and Preparations\n\nIf your project involves electrical and plumbing work, we will handle the process of **obtaining all the necessary permits** so as not to do it last minute.\n\n- Our architect stays on top of the local codes and works closely with the city so at the time we don’t have to wait the long months for approval of a building project.\n- When the pre-set date comes to start the project, we will have everything in our warehouse so we won’t need to delay the project because the tile or countertops didn’t come on time or the bathroom tub and toilet have been sold out.\n\n### Project Execution\n\nWe start each project by making **area preparations** where we make sure nothing will get damaged and delay workflow or get in your way of life.\n\n- Throughout the whole process, we keep an **active communication channel** where we are available all day long and no call or text goes unnoticed.\n- We prioritize communication with our clients since it’s the backbone of the successful completion of a project.\n- We even offer a **video monitoring solution** that helps you keep track of the progress and keep you worry-free when you are not home.\n\n### Project Stages\n\nThe project is always **broken down into stages**, be it a plumbing inspection, electrical inspection, or even just demolition.\n\n- Through every stage, we notify you and proceed to the next when you give us the green light.\n- The whole process of the project is thought out and planned thoroughly, we emphasize communication and adherence to a strict timeline on our behalf.\n- We also integrated a **policy for delays** where we give you a significant discount for each day we are behind the deadline.\n- We pride ourselves in **punctuality, attention to detail, and craftsmanship**.\n\n### Positive and Worry-Free Experience\n\nAll this is done to make sure that your experience with Renova Contractors LLC is **positive and worry-free**, working with us- the best choice made for your house. */
