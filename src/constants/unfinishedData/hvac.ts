		p: "We install HVAC systems from the most reliable manufacturers in America. Lennox, Trane, Goodman, American Standard, Ruud, and Daikin have all been the frontrunners in producing the best HVAC systems. When choosing an HVAC system, remember that you're buying it for home comfort. A system must be reliable and durable; regular cleaning and maintenance keep it running longer. We consult with you thoroughly to make sure you pick the best fit for your home.",

			"### Does brand matter?\n\nAbsolutely, the brand of your HVAC system matters. Even though the manufacturers we work with all have a reputable line of products, it doesn’t hide the fact that each system is different, with some being more suitable for your needs than others. It is important to study the characteristics of each HVAC system and see which one has the most compatibility with your vision. For instance, both Goodman and American Standard produce excellent HVAC systems. Goodman's prices are lower than those of American Standard, but their average lifespan is five years shorter. The noise level of the American Standard AC system ranges from 55 to 75 dB, whereas Goodman's starts at a significantly higher level of 71 dB. Additionally, the SEER (seasonal energy efficiency level) ranges for both Goodman and American Standard are nearly identical, ranging from 13–25 and 14–25, respectively. It is worth mentioning that Goodman ranges between 8,000 and 15,000, while the latter one starts at 15,000 and goes all the way up to 20,000. Obviously, depending on budget, the American Standard would get Renova's vote, but perhaps if the budget doesn't allow for such pricing, the Goodman AC system will serve its purpose reliably.Upkeep also plays a huge role, no matter what system you choose.<br>Comparing a Daikin furnace and a Lennox furnace based on AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency), you won't see much of a difference between the two, from 80%–97% on the Daikin and 80%–98.8% on the Lennox furnace. The Lennox is a premium-rated furnace with a higher price tag but a lifespan of 2–25 years, whereas the Daikin is a standard-rated one with a lifespan of 15-20 years.\n\nEach system has its own advantages; it's crucial to remember that while one system may suit your needs, it may not be the best option for you due to other factors. We recommend starting with a detailed consultation, through which we will be able to present you with several options with a detailed explanation of why we picked them.",

			"### HVAC Installation Process\n\nFor HVAC installation, the most important part is picking the system that fits your home and covers all your comfort requirements. We recommend having a thorough consultation with our electrician to choose an HVAC system that works best for you and offers great energy savings on your electrical bills. Following the consultation, our electrician will review their notes and create an estimate based on the chosen HVAC system. This process may take several days.Once you make your decision, we will procure the necessary materials from our suppliers and commence the project on the pre-arranged date. HVAC installation should not take a long time, and the time of the installation process varies. While the spacing, measurements, and actual installation require a significant amount of time, we can install other systems, such as ductless and mini-split systems, in a matter of a day. We also offer a group of experts who will repair everything following the installation of the HVAC system, encompassing the drywall and other house components that require restoration to their original state.\n\nThe process is straightforward: first a call, then a consultation, after which we give you several days to decide on the system you prefer based on our consultation and emails. Once you have decided, we will order the components and begin installation on the arranged date. When necessary, we obtain permits for the installation, complete each inspection, and keep you updated throughout the process. If any repairs are necessary after installation, a different technician arrives to restore the house to its original condition. Once we receive your approval, we will complete the final walkthrough. Following this, you can relish your newly acquired comfort.",

		{
			question: "How often should I replace my air filter?",
			answer: "Aside from annual maintenance, air filter replacement for both your furnace and air conditioner is the best way to keep your HVAC system functioning. Depending on your type of heating and cooling device, it could use a replaceable air filter or one that only requires cleaning.",
		},
		{
			question: "Why is my air conditioner freezing?",
			answer: "Whether it's summer or winter, your air conditioner shouldn't have ice building up. This indicates one of two problems: either your evaporator or condenser coils have built up dirt or become clogged with leaves, or there's a refrigerant leak causing low pressure. Cleaning the coils or addressing the refrigerant issue typically resolves the problem.",
		},
		{
			question: "What size HVAC system do I need?",

		},
		{
			question: "How long does an HVAC system last?",
			answer: "Typically, HVAC systems last between 15 to 25 years. Regular maintenance can extend the lifespan of your system, while neglect can reduce it. The exact lifespan depends on the type and quality of the system, as well as how well it is maintained.",
		},
		{
			question: "What is involved in HVAC maintenance?",
			answer: "HVAC maintenance involves inspecting and cleaning system components, checking refrigerant levels, inspecting and cleaning ductwork, and ensuring all parts are working correctly. Regular maintenance helps prevent breakdowns and extends the lifespan of the system.",
		},
		{
			question: "Why is my HVAC system making strange noises?",
			answer: "Strange noises from your HVAC system can indicate various issues, such as loose parts, debris in the unit, or problems with the blower motor. It's essential to have these noises checked by a professional to prevent further damage.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"How can I improve indoor air quality with my HVAC system?",
