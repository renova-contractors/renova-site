		{
			question: "How do I know if my house windows are bad?",
			answer: "It can be hard to open and close a window that doesn't work right, which can be annoying. Old windows can let in cold drafts or make your house less energy efficient.

		},
		{
			question: "How can you tell if a window is good quality?",
