			"#### How we work more in detail\nOur process starts with an initial consultation where we discuss the project scope, budget, and timeline. We assess the existing space, take measurements, and identify client needs, preferences, and goals. In the design phase, we develop initial design concepts and layouts, create detailed architectural and engineering plans, and present design options to the client for feedback and approval. During budgeting and cost estimation, we prepare a detailed cost estimate, review and finalize the budget with the client, and adjust the design or scope if needed to fit the budget. We handle permits and approvals by submitting necessary plans and applications to local authorities, obtaining building permits and any other required approvals, and addressing any revisions or additional requirements from authorities. Material selection involves choosing materials, fixtures, and finishes, sourcing and ordering all necessary materials, and coordinating delivery schedules. Scheduling and planning include developing a detailed project timeline and schedule, coordinating with subcontractors and suppliers, and setting milestones and deadlines for each phase of the project. Pre-construction preparation involves clearing and preparing the workspace, setting up temporary utilities or structures as needed, and protecting existing structures and surfaces from damage. Demolition includes safely removing existing structures, fixtures, and finishes, disposing of debris and waste in accordance with regulations, and ensuring a clean and safe worksite. Construction and installation involve executing construction work as per the design plan, installing new structures, systems, and finishes, and ensuring quality and compliance with building codes. Finally, the process concludes with a final walkthrough and handover, where we conduct a final walkthrough with the client, identify any remaining tasks or touch-ups, complete them, finalize all work, clean the site, and hand over the remodeled space to the client.",
