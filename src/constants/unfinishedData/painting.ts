			"##### How We Work\n\nWhenever we begin a job, we always begin with a comprehensive consultation, during which we learn about the colors you desire and the overall scope of the project. We will be able to provide you with an estimate as soon as we obtain that information. We are able to make revisions based on the estimations, and our designer is able to walk you through the process of selecting the paint that will be suitable for your home. When we have reached a consensus on the color, we will go out and get the paint, and then we will bring it to your house. On the date that was previously agreed upon, we will start the project by prepping the area that will be worked on, applying the paint in between each coat, demonstrating the results, and moving on to the next stage provided that you give your approval. Immediately after we have completed applying all of the paint, we will clean up and then hand over the job to you.",
