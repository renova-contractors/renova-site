			"### Comprehensive Decking Services at RENOVA üè°\n\nRENOVA provides a full range of decking services, from new deck stairs and railings to deck refinishing and repairs. We build custom decks for pools, roofs, or any location, incorporating features like slip-resistant tracks for added safety. Our decking options include TREX, timber, and composite materials, tailored to your lifestyle and preferences. üå≥",

To ensure long-lasting results, deck installation heavily relies on the timely delivery of top-notch products and materials.

		markdownmanufacturers:
			"##### Trusted Decking Manufacturers üåü\n\nWe frequently suggest that our clients purchase from suppliers and manufacturers that have demonstrated the use of durable and high-quality materials. Fiberon and Trex are two of the most reputable decking manufacturers. Fiberon and Trex offer durable and visually appealing products, backed by an exceptional warranty. It is crucial to consider your own requirements when evaluating various manufacturers. For instance, TimberTech and Trex are both excellent choices. TimberTech, a composite decking material, combines reclaimed wood fiber with high-performance, recycled polymers. Made from reclaimed wood fiber and recycled polymers, TimberTech excels in performance. Trex, which has almost the same qualities as a high-quality product with an aesthetically pleasing material that is durable, can cost significantly less than TimberTech‚Äîon average, 20%‚Äì40% less. Both companies offer a fantastic warranty. The 25-year coverage has become the industry standard. Trex and TimberTech are also low-maintenance; however, RENOVA offers an additional complimentary service where, before each season, we will make sure your deck is up to standard and fix any minor repairs. üõ†Ô∏è\n\nTrex's exceptional resistance to stains and mildew makes it an optimal choice for outdoor areas subjected to moisture and humidity. Additionally, TimberTech's protective coatings and advanced composite materials offer exceptional resistance to discoloration, mold, scratches, and stains. Trex's exceptional resistance to fungi and stains necessitates less maintenance over time, which guarantees you less time spent maintaining the deck and having it last a longer time, making it perhaps a wise investment for some. üå≥\n\nThis short comparison between two leading brands in deck manufacturing shows that there are both highly proven manufacturers, and the first thing you need to do as a homeowner is consider your needs and budget before comparing all the possible manufacturers. Our interior designer is well-versed not only in what looks great, but also in what will suit your lifestyle better, and what brands and items have the best warranty and fit for your home.",

			"##### How We Work at RENOVA üõ†Ô∏è\n\nEvery job at RENOVA begins with a full consultation, in which we learn about your needs and create an accurate estimate for your project. This way, we won't confront any problematic or unresolved concerns. RENOVA emphasizes communication üìû and views it as the first step toward a successful project. After you've received the pricing estimate, we'll go over the project's timeline and procedure, create specific architectural designs if necessary, and obtain all city permissions while you talk with our designer about the features you want for your deck.\n\nIf you have an existing deck, we will demo it according to the scope of work specified and begin construction of the new deck based on the architectural drawings created by RENOVA's architect, with each stage of the process approved by you and the city authorities. We closely adhere to project deadlines ‚è∞. Prior to the final walkthrough, we restore your property to its pre-existing condition by inspecting and ensuring that everything looks good. After we hand over the project to you, please enjoy it to the fullest, and don't forget that we provide an at-no-charge checkup service before each summer season ‚òÄÔ∏è.",

	faqItems: [
		{
			question: "What is the downside of decking?",
			answer: "Homeowners often complain about the temperature of their wood composite decks. Composite decking absorbs and retains heat, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The boards may take hours to cool down before you can walk on them comfortably without shoes.",
		},
		{
			question: "What is the average lifespan of decking?",
			answer: "On average, timber decking lasts for between 15 and 30 years. With the right care and maintenance, your decking can last for decades, come rain or shine.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does decking need foundations?",
			answer: "The framework for a decking should be laid onto concrete foundations. The supporting decking posts need to be mounted on a concrete area or set in dug concrete foundations. If digging foundations, dig a hole to suit the dimensions of the post, pour in the concrete, and insert the post.",
		},
		{
			question: "What wood lasts longest for decking?",
			answer: "Ipe, cedar, and redwood are all wood types that are known for lasting 20 years or more. Although these are not the most budget-friendly lumber options out there, they are highly durable and long-lasting, which makes them an excellent choice for building decks.",
		},
		{
			question: "How do I maintain my new deck?",
			answer: "Regular maintenance includes sweeping or hosing down the deck to remove dirt and debris, applying a suitable deck cleaner, and reapplying a protective finish or sealant as needed. Specific maintenance may vary based on the type of decking material.",
		},
		{
			question: "Are there eco-friendly decking options?",
			answer: "Yes, there are many eco-friendly decking options including composite materials made from recycled plastics, bamboo, and sustainably sourced wood. These materials offer durability and a lower environmental impact.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"What should I consider when choosing decking for high-traffic areas?",
			answer: "For high-traffic areas, choose durable materials like composite decking or hardwood. These options are resilient, easy to clean, and can withstand heavy use without showing significant wear and tear.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"Can I install a deck myself or should I hire a professional?",
			answer: "While some homeowners may choose to install a deck themselves, hiring a professional ensures the job is done correctly and safely. Professionals have the expertise, tools, and knowledge to handle complex installations and meet local building codes.",
