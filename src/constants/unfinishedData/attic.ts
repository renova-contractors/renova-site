		p: "To successfully finish an attic, you need various products to ensure functionality, comfort, and code compliance. For insulation, consider Owens Corning's Fiberglass Batt Insulation or spray foam insulation from Icynene. Use USG Sheetrock for drywall, and add flooring like Armstrong Laminate or Bruce Hardwood. Ensure proper ventilation with Air Vent ridge and soffit vents. Electrical wiring and outlets from Leviton, combined with recessed lighting from Halo, will brighten the space. For heating and cooling, Mitsubishi's ductless HVAC systems are ideal. Energy-efficient windows and skylights from Andersen enhance natural light. Use acoustic panels from ATS Acoustics for soundproofing and add finishing touches with Sherwin-Williams paint. Lastly, built-in shelving from ClosetMaid and safety devices like Kidde smoke detectors are essential.",
		markdownmanufacturers:
			"##### Insulation Matters\n\nInsulation is crucial in attic finishing because it enhances energy efficiency, reduces heating and cooling costs, and improves overall comfort. Quality insulation materials like Owens Corning Fiberglass Batt Insulation provide excellent thermal resistance and prevent heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer. Icynene spray foam insulation offers superior air sealing, filling gaps and cracks to prevent drafts and moisture infiltration. Proper insulation, like these brands, helps maintain a consistent indoor temperature, reduces energy consumption, and contributes to a more sustainable and comfortable living environment.",

			"###### How We Remodel Attics\n\nRENOVA tries to make attic renovation as simple as possible, so we developed a special method for our attic projects with a dedicated team that specializes in attic remodels and renovations.\n\nWe start with a simple consultation that helps us get an accurate idea of what you want; based on the insight we have, we will give you an accurate estimate. Once you approve the estimate, our interior designer will visit you to discuss the project and create a rendering of your future attic. After finalizing the rendering and SVCP, we will order the necessary materials and commence the project on the scheduled date. With all plumbing and electrical permits approved, we will pass all the inspections, keeping you in the loop throughout the project. After completing the electrical and plumbing work, we will proceed to install drywall, pave the attic, and begin the flooring installation. After attaching all necessary fixtures and conducting a final inspection, we will complete the project and offer a comprehensive house cleaning following the attic finishing or remodeling.",
