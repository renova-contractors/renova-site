			"##### Process for projects\n\n RENOVA begins the excavation process with a consultation to understand your project demands, assess site requirements, and deliver a full project overview. Site investigation and assessment, including a thorough survey and condition evaluation, inform the excavation plan. We then plan and design, creating a detailed blueprint and adhering to the rules. We transparently estimate and budget costs, as well as obtain all permissions and approvals.\n\nSite preparation, obstacle clearance, and ground leveling come after the groundwork phase. Our excavation and earthworks phases require precision and big machinery. After excavation, we build drainage and utilities to keep water flowing. We maintain project quality through regular inspections and quality monitoring. Final grading and site cleanup prepare the site for construction and ensures its cleanliness. This methodical approach guarantees the timely completion of every project while maintaining the highest standards.",
