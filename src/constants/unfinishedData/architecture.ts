Using these tools helps us increase our precision and efficiency in creating detailed architectural plans and models for our clients.",
		markdownmanufacturers:
			"##### RENOVA's Dual Software Approach\nRENOVA employs both software systems for their architects. While each system has its own unique features and drawbacks, they are currently the best available on the market. We utilize these systems to provide our clients with architectural designs and detailed plans. AutoCAD excels in 2D and 3D drafting, giving our architects an added advantage and a wide variety of tools for technical and detailed drawings. Its user interface and compatibility with other programs make it easy for us to use.\n\n###### Revit for Complex Projects\nHowever, for more complex projects that are more technical or commercial, we prefer using Revit because it allows RENOVA to create comprehensive digital representations of buildings. We prefer to use Revit on larger-scale projects due to its superior BIM (Building Information Modeling), which allows multiple teams to work on the project simultaneously. The one drawback is that it is much harder to navigate and operate, which could be a challenge for new architects. Additionally, Revit‚Äôs focus on BIM may be overkill for simpler projects where traditional CAD software like AutoCAD would suffice.",
