We strive to be a 100% transparent company, offering many references to our past clients to assure you of our stellar reputation in electrical installations.\n\n### Circuit Breaker Boxes\n\nA circuit breaker box is one of the most vital parts of a functioning electrical system in your home. A high-quality electrical panel enables you to increase your amps; the breaker panel's socket count is crucial, enabling you to add more circuit breakers; and the quantity of circuits is crucial, ensuring you meet all your requirements. Since the number of circuits is typically twice the number of spaces, a circuit breaker panel typically supports 16 or 24 circuits. There are many other criteria to consider, such as warranty and durability.\n\n**Eaton Circuit Breaker Panel**\nThe Eaton Circuit Breaker Panel and Siemens P1224L3125CU Circuit Breaker Panel offer a ten-year warranty, while the Siemens Circuit Breaker Panel and Blue Sea Systems Circuit Breaker Panel offer a 1- to 3-year warranty cover with significantly fewer available spaces. If that is ideal for heavy-duty use, then the Eaton Circuit Breaker Panel can be the perfect choice. It has an impressive current rating of up to 200 amps. This allows it to offer a total of 40 spaces, along with support for 40 circuits. This heavy-duty circuit breaker panel comes with a 10-year warranty.\n\n**Siemens E0816ML1125S Circuit Breaker Panel**\nDue to budget restrictions, those of you looking for a budget-oriented circuit breaker panel can go with the Siemens E0816ML1125S Circuit Breaker Panel. Despite being the most affordable circuit breaker panel mentioned above, it has a decent current rating of up to 125 amps. You also get a fairly large size with it since this circuit breaker panel comes with 8 spaces and support for 16 circuits.",

			"### RENOVA Electrical Project Process\n\nJust like with any project, RENOVA loves to start with a consultation, a thorough meeting where we inspect your current wiring and see what you want our electricians to do. After we get your vision, we start working on our estimate. The estimate does not take long, and our clients usually get it the next day. Our estimates are very accurate, so you don’t have to worry about surprise costs later on. We don’t like leading on our clients by lowering the price just to get the project.Each day, our electrical team manager reviews the estimates and makes corrections based on the videos and notes provided by our estimator, who is also an electrician. Once you approve the quote, we begin by obtaining a permit for the electrical work. Once we obtain the necessary permit, we proceed with the demolition.\n\nOur licensed electricians will commence the work immediately, demonstrating the initial state of your wiring. Through each stage, we will show you the progress. After passing the inspection, we restore your space to its original state before implementing any electrical finishes, following which the city conducts a second inspection. After passing all inspections and restoring the area to its original state, we meticulously clean the space before delivering the final product to you for your approval.Since the local authorities regulate a lot of the electrical work, the process is straightforward. The finishes and touch-ups, on the other hand, are for you to judge, but we will make sure to leave your home with a 100% satisfaction rating.",
