			"##### Masonry Project Process\n\nThe process for a masonry project starts with a thorough consultation, site analysis and assessments, and also getting to know your project goals. Once we have all the needed information, we will design and plan the project, basing our cost estimate on our rendering and plans. Upon approval of the cost sheet, we proceed to the stage of securing any necessary permits for the project, particularly for additions or home construction. While we are obtaining permits, we will get the project site prepared for the work. When we have everything ready and approved, the masonry work and installation begin. We ensure your approval at every stage of the process by keeping you informed. Upon completion of the project, we conduct a final walkthrough, inspection, and cleanup, following which we transfer the project to you.",
