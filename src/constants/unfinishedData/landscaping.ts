			"##### Renova Landscaping and Hardscaping Services\n\nWhen it comes to landscaping projects, the process is straightforward. It starts with a consultation, during which we get a broad overview of your project, collect as much information as we can, and then send out a rough estimate. As soon as we have received approval, we will begin the process of analyzing and evaluating the site. Based on this information, our landscaping architect and designer will show you the various plant selections available to you, supply you with renderings, and provide you with a more accurate cost sheet. Once you approve the design, we will begin site preparation and material acquisition for both softscaping and hardscaping. After the hardscaping phase concludes, the softscaping phase will involve planting the ordered plants and trees. During the final stages of the project, we will give the finished product to you after we have finished cleaning up everything and performing a last walkthrough.",
