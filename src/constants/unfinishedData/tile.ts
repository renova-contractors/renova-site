			"#### How We Work\nOur process begins with a consultation to understand your needs, budget, and timeline. We assess the space, take measurements, and discuss design preferences. In the design phase, we create layouts and plans, presenting options for your approval. We then prepare a detailed cost estimate, finalize the budget, and make any necessary adjustments. We handle all permits and approvals, ensuring everything is in order before starting the project. Material selection is guided by your preferences, and we coordinate the sourcing and delivery of all materials. We develop a project timeline, coordinating with subcontractors and suppliers to keep the project on track. Pre-construction involves preparing the workspace and protecting your home from damage. We then proceed with demolition, removing old materials and ensuring a clean, safe site. During construction, we install your new tile with precision, adhering to design plans and building codes. The project concludes with a final walkthrough, addressing any last details before handing over your beautifully tiled space.",

	faqItems: [
		{
			question: "Why is tile installation tends to be expensive?",
			answer: "Tile flooring costs are influenced by room size, tile pattern and layout, and subfloor preparation. Larger floors and intricate patterns increase laborcosts, and significant subfloor repairs can add to the expense.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is it cheaper to lay large or small tiles?",
			answer: "While larger tiles cover more area and may seem cost-effective, they are harder to install and often require more time and skill, which can increase labor costs.",
		},
		{
			question: "When should you not use large tiles?",
			answer: "Large tiles are not ideal for intricate designs or when mixing shapes and colors. For detailed patterns, smaller tiles are a better option.",
		},
		{
			question: "Which grout size is best",
			answer: "A grout size of 1/8-inch for non-rectified tiles is recommended. This size provides a clean, uniform appearance while accepting modest differences in tile measurements.  ",
