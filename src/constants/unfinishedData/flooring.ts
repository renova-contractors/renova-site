Over the years, we have developed great relationships with some of the best flooring manufacturers. Choose your modified vinyl plank flooring from Coreluxe, which has earned Greenguard and Floor Score certifications, ensuring high-quality materials that won't contaminate your home's air, keeping it fresh and clean. It's not a bad idea to drop by Mohawk, a manufacturer that has a wide variety of reliable and durable flooring options for all your home’s needs. We'd also like to highlight RL Colston as the go-to for a wide variety of hardwood floors. Bellawood - manufacturer of high-quality engineered hardwood that has proven to be a durable and reliable product for many of our clients. Each one of these manufacturers proved themselves with their reliable and aesthetic products, which left RENOVA and our clients happy throughout the many years. ",

			"### Deciding What You Prioritize in Flooring\n\nBefore comparing manufacturers, one must decide what they prioritize and expect from their floors. While hardwood may be best for some homes, those with large animals and children may want to wait. Keep in mind that hardwood floors are harder on your dog's joints, but having carpets everywhere is also not the best idea; they are collectors of dust and other allergens and difficult to clean. There are numerous factors to consider when selecting a flooring option. Before making a choice, carefully consider all factors. Once you get your pick, we can start comparing manufacturers and narrowing down the options that will fit your home perfectly.",

			"### The RENOVA Flooring Installation Process\n\nRENOVA always starts with a detailed consultation, during which we discuss the project at hand and the nuances of the job. After the consultation, we call different floor manufacturers and distributors to find out the approximate prices for flooring, be it tile, LVT, LVP, hardwood, or carpet, depending on what product you show interest in. After obtaining the prices, we will prepare a detailed quote for the required labor, which you should receive in your email the following day.\n\nWhen you decide to proceed with RENOVA, we will send our interior designer to take a look and consult you on the flooring options and brands. Our interior designer will help you visualize your future floor. Once you have chosen a specific brand, we will order the necessary materials, along with the option you chose, and set a date for the floor installation to begin.We'll arrive before the start date to examine the property once more. The team will acquaint themselves with the house and their designated project area, determining the necessary preparations. Once the project date comes, we will be there working at the pre-agreed time. Each project takes different amounts of time, but we always meet our deadlines. We arrive prepared for the project, ensuring no delays.\n\nAt each stage of the project, we show you everything, and if any unexpected issues arise, we always consult with you before proceeding. Upon project completion, we always offer a complimentary house cleaning service to ensure that you enjoy your new floors to the fullest.",

	faqItems: [
		{
			question: "Does sunlight affect my floors?",
			answer: "Direct sunlight beaming onto your flooring will have an impact no matter which option you choose. Wood flooring will change color when exposed to years of sunlight, which can come as a surprise when furniture or rugs are moved. Surface-dyed nylon and wool carpets are also susceptible to fading. Solution-dyed nylon has exceptional fade resistance.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is it OK to lay new flooring over old flooring?",
			answer: "Most flooring installed with the floating method can be installed over your existing flooring if it meets the following criteria: The existing flooring is securely fastened to the subfloor, the subfloor is in suitable shape, and raising the floor height will not cause a tripping hazard in doorways to and from other rooms.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I put laminate over laminate?",
			answer: "Installing one laminate flooring over another can cause more costly problems to fix over time. For this reason, we always recommend removing the existing laminate before installing a new one.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"What is the best flooring for an old house with uneven floors?",
			answer: "Both vinyl and laminate floors are versatile and durable options that can be installed over slightly uneven surfaces. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to clean and maintain, and come in a wide range of patterns and colors so you don't have to sacrifice style for function.",
		},
		{
			question: "How do I maintain my new floors?",
			answer: "Regular maintenance includes sweeping or vacuuming to remove dirt and debris, using a damp mop for cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals, and placing mats at entryways to reduce tracked-in dirt. Specific maintenance may vary based on the type of flooring.",
		},
		{
			question: "What is the lifespan of different flooring types?",
			answer: "The lifespan varies by material: hardwood floors can last over 50 years with proper care, laminate flooring typically lasts 15-25 years, vinyl flooring can last 20-30 years, and carpets generally need to be replaced every 10-15 years.",
		},
		{
			question: "Are there eco-friendly flooring options?",
			answer: "Yes, there are many eco-friendly flooring options including bamboo, cork, and reclaimed wood. These materials are sustainable and offer a variety of styles and finishes to suit any home décor.",
		},
		{
			question:
